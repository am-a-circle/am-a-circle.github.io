# Learning about how to hack car.

Welcome to the first of many blog posts in the world of car pentesting! As vehicles continue to integrate electronic systems, software, and network connectivity, they become vulnerable to malicious attacks.

Car pentesting is a cybersecurity field that focuses on identifying security weaknesses in automotive systems. By exploring the vulnerabilities found in modern cars, we can better understand the risks associated with their digital infrastructure and work towards establishing robust defenses.

In this blog post series, we will embark on a journey to learn how modern vehicles can be hacked and how to identify vulnerabilities within them. We will delve into various topics, including:

-   Exploring the Controller Area Network (CAN) Bus Protocol.
-   Setting up can-utils to connect to CAN devices.
-   Unraveling the process of reverse engineering the CAN Bus.
-   Venturing into the realm of ECU hacking.

Through this exploration, my aim is to share what I have learned about automotive cybersecurity and its practical approach. Whether you are a cybersecurity enthusiast, an automotive industry professional, or simply curious about the intersection of technology and automobiles, this blog post series will serve as a valuable introduction to the captivating domain of car pentesting.

So, fasten your seatbelts and get ready for an exhilarating ride into the world of car pentesting.

## Bus Protocol

Vehicle bus protocols govern the transfer of packets within your vehicle's network, enabling communication among numerous sensors and controlling the vehicle's behavior and information flow. Each vehicle manufacturer selects the most suitable bus and protocols for their vehicles. 

While the CAN bus is a standardized protocol found on the OBD-II connector of all vehicles, the packets transmitted over the CAN bus itself are not standardized. To identify the specific bus lines for your vehicle, you can refer to its OBD-II pinout available online.

In this blog post, we will provide an overview of the various bus systems and protocols you may encounter in your vehicle but only focus on the CAN Bus Protocol. 

### CAN Bus

CAN, an essential protocol in manufacturing and the automotive industry, enables communication between embedded systems and electronic control units (ECUs) in modern vehicles. While CAN has been a standard on US cars and light trucks since 1996, it only became mandatory in 2008 (2001 for European vehicles). If your car predates 1996, it may still have CAN, but verification is necessary.

CAN operates on two wires, namely CAN high (CANH) and CAN low (CANL). It employs differential signaling, where a signal raises the voltage on one wire while simultaneously decreasing it by an equal amount on the other wire. Differential signaling is crucial in environments that require noise tolerance, such as automotive systems and manufacturing.

### The OBD-II Connector
Most vehicles have an OBD-II connector, also called the diagnostic link connector (DLC), that connects to the internal network of the vehicle. Typically located under the steering column or discreetly placed on the dashboard, these connectors may be concealed behind access panels and can be black or white in color. While some are easily accessible, others may be tucked away under plastic.

### CAN Bus Packet Layout
There are two types of CAN packets: standard and extended. 
Extended packets are like standard ones but with a larger space to hold IDs.

**Standard Packets**  

Standard CAN bus packets consist of four essential elements: 
- arbitration ID - dentifies the device attempting to communicate, with the lower ID winning in case of simultaneous transmission
- identifier extension (IDE) - This bit is always 0 for standard CAN
- data length code (DLC) - This is the size of the data, which ranges from 0 to 8 bytes.
- data - This is the data itself. The maximum size of the data carried by a standard CAN bus packet can be up to 8 bytes, but some systems force 8 bytes by padding out the packet.

Since CAN bus packets are broadcasted, all controllers on the network receive them, similar to UDP on Ethernet networks. The packets do not include information about the sender. This allows any device on the bus to simulate another device easily.

**Extended packets** can be linked together to create longer IDs while maintaining backward compatibility. They fit within standard CAN formatting, ensuring compatibility with devices that do not support extended packets. Extended packets use substitute remote request (SRR) instead of remote transmission request (RTR), have the IDE set to 1, and feature an 18-bit identifier as the second part of the standard 11-bit identifier.

In addition to extended CAN, some manufacturers use their own CAN-style protocols that are also backward compatible with standard CAN.
