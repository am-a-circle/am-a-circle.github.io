## Overview

Recently took on the CRTP course and passed the exam ! 
Definitely a great introductory course to learn more about the approach of attacking and defending Active Directory.

Some review that goes in depth to what you can expect from the course.

If you are like me and prefer to "pre-study" before taking any course  (OSCP woes), I recommend setting up a simple lab to have a hands on approach. Wrote a simple guide to on doing so: [https://4treetwo.gitbook.io/rhea-horizon-v0.1/](https://4treetwo.gitbook.io/rhea-horizon-v0.1/)

Onwards to CRTE (Probably taking a long break first!)
