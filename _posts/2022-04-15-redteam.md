## Overview

Recently took on the CRTP course and passed the exam ! Definitely a great introductory course to learn more about the approach of attacking and defending Active Directory.

If you are like me and prefer to "pre-study" before taking any course  (OSCP woes), I recommend setting up a simple lab to have a hands on approach. Wrote a simple guide to on doing so: https://4treetwo.gitbook.io/rhea-horizon-v0.1/

Onwards to CRTE (Probably taking a long break first lol)
