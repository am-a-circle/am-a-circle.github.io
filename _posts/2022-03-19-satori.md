## Overview

A vulnerable machine that is very OSCP like. Think outside the box, enumerate at places you don't usually do and understanding of exploiting the vulnerability to do a LFI.

We can see that there is an anonymous account on the FTP server.
Additionally, http is hosting a nginx 1.14.2, application called youtube-downloader.

Begin enumeration.

## FTP - TCP 21

Enumerate the anonymous FTP account to find a `.mkv`. Honestly, a dead end which shows an interesting video if you get there :) However, further enumeration shows nothing interesting.
```bash

We can see a Youtube Downloader application from [here](https://github.com/Athlon1600/youtube-downloader).
![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/am-a-circle/am-a-circle.github.io/main/assets/img/hackmyvm/satori/satori1.png)
Further enumeration shows that there exist a SSRF vulnerability :

Great we got a SSRF! From [Hacktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssrf-server-side-request-forgery#file) , we know that we can try to read the localhost File by supplying the below:
![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/am-a-circle/am-a-circle.github.io/main/assets/img/hackmyvm/satori/satori5.png)
After enumerating the `/etc/passwd` file there is only a user called **yana** .
![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/am-a-circle/am-a-circle.github.io/main/assets/img/hackmyvm/satori/satori7.png)

## Shell as Yana

Trying to SSH into yana show's that we need its publickey to access the server.
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/hackmyv/satori]
â””â”€# ssh yana@192.168.56.69                                                                                         
The authenticity of host '192.168.56.69 (192.168.56.69)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:qOlHItKY4wk+MzNIJgzvdD3C17EaDA1k/uYmSNfmhAk.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '192.168.56.69' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
yana@192.168.56.69: Permission denied (publickey).
```
Enumerating the FTP server with user yana allow us to find the password through a bruteforce attack!
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/hackmyv/satori]
â””â”€# hydra -t 64 -l yana -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 192.168.56.69 ftp

Enumerating the ftp server shows what we a need, a `id_rsa` under the .ssh server.
![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/am-a-circle/am-a-circle.github.io/main/assets/img/hackmyvm/satori/satori9.png)


Download the file and we are in!
```bash

â””â”€# chmod 600 id_rsa

## Shell as Root

Running linpeas shows that user yana is under the `Disk` group which has a common privs escalation technique! 
![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/am-a-circle/am-a-circle.github.io/main/assets/img/hackmyvm/satori/satori10.png)
Based on [hacktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation/interesting-groups-linux-pe#disk-group):

> This privilege is almost **equivalent to root access** as you can
> access all the data inside of the machine.
> Note that using debugfs you can also **write files**. For example to copy `/tmp/asd1.txt` to `/tmp/asd2.txt`.


Execute the vulnerability and enumerate, we find a private key for the root user:
